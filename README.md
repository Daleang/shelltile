# ShellTile

A tiling window extension for GNOME Shell. Just move a window over another one, holding down the Control key, and you'll see the magic! Grouped windows minimize, resize, raise and change workspace together. Maximize a window to remove it from the group.

### Example of tiling with multiple windows (holding CTRL)
